"""
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. 
For example, "racecar" and "level" are palindromes because they spell the same thing in both directions. 
In phrases or sentences, spaces and punctuation are often ignored, so "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" is also a palindrome.

"""
1. Take a string from the user
2. Write a function to check if the string is a palindrome
   a) Initialize an empty list to store characters
   b) Loop through each character in the input string
   c) Join the list into a single cleaned string
   d) Check if the cleaned string reads the same forwards and backwards
3. Create an if-else statement to call the function & print true result in if block & false result in else block
