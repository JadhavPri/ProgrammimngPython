"""
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. 
For example, "racecar" and "level" are palindromes because they spell the same thing in both directions. 
In phrases or sentences, spaces and punctuation are often ignored, so "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama!" is also a palindrome.
